/**
 * The possible locations in an HTTP request where an OAuth 2 bearer token may be found and used for authenticating
 * the request.  By default, the SDK will only inspect the {@link #HEADER} and {@link #BODY} during a request; using
 * request parameters for authentication is generally discouraged for security reasons.  That being said, if you have a
 * specific need for using request parameters, such as supporting a legacy HTTP client, you can configure the SDK to
 * check the {@link #QUERY_PARAM} location as well.  Example configuration below.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>When you accept a known OAuth HTTP request, you can specify the request locations that will be checked when
 * retrieving the OAuth Access Token used to authenticate the request.  For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import static com.okta.sdk.oauth.RequestLocation.*;
 * ...
 *
 * application.authenticateOauth(httpRequest).<b>{@link OAuthApiRequestAuthenticator#inLocation(RequestLocation...) inLocation}</b>(HEADER, BODY, QUERY_PARAM).execute();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Again, by default, the SDK will automatically inspect the {@link #HEADER} and {@link #BODY}.  You must explicitly
 * add {@link #QUERY_PARAM} if you wish to use query parameters for authentication, as query parameters are generally
 * not considered as secure as the other two locations.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.0.RC
 * @see OAuthApiRequestAuthenticator#inLocation(RequestLocation...)
 * @see ResourceRequestAuthenticator#inLocation(RequestLocation...)
