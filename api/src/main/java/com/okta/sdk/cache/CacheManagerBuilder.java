/**
 * Builder for creating simple {@link CacheManager} instances <b>suitable for SINGLE-JVM APPLICATIONS</b>.  If your
 * application is deployed (mirrored or clustered) across multiple JVMs, you might not
 * want to use this builder and use your own clusterable CacheManager implementation instead.  See Clustering below.
 * <h2>Clustering</h2>
 * <b>The default CacheManager instances created by this Builder DO NOT SUPPORT CLUSTERING</b>.
 * <p>
 * If you use this Builder and your application is deployed on multiple JVMs, <b>each of your application instances will
 * have <em>their own</em> local cache of Okta data</b>.  Depending on your application requirements, and your
 * cache TTL and TTI settings, this could introduce a significant difference in cached data seen by your application
 * instances, which would likely impact user management behavior.  For example, one application instance could see an
 * account as ENABLED, but the other application instance could see it as DISABLED.
 * <p>
 * For some applications, this discrepancy might be an acceptable trade-off, especially if you configure
 * {@link #withDefaultTimeToIdle(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) timeToIdle} and
 * {@link #withDefaultTimeToLive(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) timeToLive} settings low enough.  For example,
 * maybe a TTL of 5 or 10 minutes is an acceptable time to see 'stale' account data.  For other applications, this might
 * not be acceptable.  If it is acceptable, configuring the timeToIdle and timeToLive settings will allow you to
 * fine-tune how much variance you allow.
 * <p>
 * However, if you are concerned about this difference in data and you want the Okta SDK's cache to be coherent
 * across your application nodes (typically a good thing to have), it is strongly recommended that you do not use this
 * Builder and instead configure the Okta SDK with a clustered {@code CacheManager} implementation of your choosing.
 * This approach still gives you excellent performance improvements and ensures that your cached data is coherent (seen
 * as the same) across all of your application instances.
 * <p>
 * This comes with an increased cost of course: setting up a caching product and/or cluster.  However, this is not
 * much of a problem in practice: most multi-instance applications already leverage caching clusters for their own
 * application needs. In these environments, and with a proper {@code CacheManager} implementation leveraging a
 * clustered cache, the Okta Java SDK will live quite happily using this same caching infrastructure.
 * <p>
 * A coherent cache deployment ensures all of your application instances/nodes can utilize the same cache policy and
 * see the same cached security/identity data.  Some example clustered caching solutions: Hazelcast,
 * Ehcache+Terracotta, Memcache, Redis, Coherence, GigaSpaces, etc.
