/**
 * A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern">Builder design pattern</a> used to
 * construct {@link com.okta.sdk.client.Client} instances.
 *
 * <p>The {@code ClientBuilder} is used to construct Client instances with Okta API Key,
 * Proxy and Cache configuration.  Understanding caching is extremely important when creating a Client instance, so
 * please ensure you read the <em>Caching</em> section below.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>The simplest usage is to just call the {@link #build() build()} method, for example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Client client = {@link Clients Clients}.builder().{@link #build() build()};
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This will:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Automatically enable a simple in-memory {@link CacheManager} for enhanced performance (but please read
 *       the <em>Caching</em> section below for effects/warnings).</li>
 *   <li>Automatically attempt to find your API Key values in a number of default/conventional locations and then use
 *       the discovered values. Without any other configuration, the following locations will be each be checked,
 *       in order:</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The default apiKey.properties file location of
 *         <code>System.getProperty("user.home") + "/.okta/apiKey.properties"</code> as
 *         recommended/documented in the <a href="https://docs.okta.com/java/quickstart/">Okta Java
 *         Quickstart</a>.</li>
 *     <li>A properties file that exists at the file path or URL specified by the {@code OKTA_API_KEY_FILE}
 *         variable.  If this file exists and contains either the apiKey id or secret properties, these values
 *         override any values found in the default apiKey.properties file.  The {@code OKTA_API_KEY_FILE}
 *         String can be an absolute file path, or it can be a URL or a classpath value by using the {@code url:} or
 *         {@code classpath:} prefixes respectively.</li>
 *     <li>The environment variables {@code OKTA_API_KEY_ID} and {@code OKTA_API_KEY_SECRET}.  If either of
 *         these values are present, they override any previously discovered value.</li>
 *     <li>A properties file that exists at the file path or URL specified by the {@code okta.client.apiKey.file}
 *         system property.  If this file exists and any values are present, the values override any
 *         previously discovered value.  The {@code okta.client.apiKey.file} system property String can be an
 *         absolute file path, or it can be a URL or a classpath value by using the {@code url:} or
 *         {@code classpath:} prefixes respectively.</li>
 *     <li>The system properties {@code okta.client.apiKey.id} and {@code okta.client.apiKey.token}.  If either of
 *         these values are present, they override any previously discovered values.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>SECURITY NOTICE:</b> While the {@code okta.client.apiKey.token} system property may be used to represent your
 * API Key Secret as mentioned above, this is not recommended: process listings on a machine will expose process
 * arguments (like system properties) and expose the secret value to anyone that can read process listings.  As
 * always, secret values should never be exposed to anyone other than the person that owns the API Key.</p>
 *
 * <p>While an API Key ID may be configured anywhere (and be visible by anyone), it is recommended to use a private
 * read-only file or an environment variable to represent API Key secrets.  <b>Never</b> commit secrets to source code
 * or version control.</p>
 *
 * <h4>Explicit API Key Configuration</h4>
 *
 * <p>The above default API Key searching heuristics may not be suitable to your needs.  In that case, you will likely
 * need to explicitly configure your API Key.  For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ApiKey apiKey = {@link com.okta.sdk.api.ApiKeys ApiKeys}.builder()
 *                 //specific configuration
 *                 .{@link #build build()};
 *
 * Client client = {@link Clients Clients}.builder().setApiKey(apiKey).build();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>See the {@link com.okta.sdk.api.ApiKeyBuilder ApiKeyBuilder} JavaDoc for specific API Key configuration
 * options.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Caching</h3>
 *
 * <p>By default, a simple production-grade in-memory {@code CacheManager} will be enabled when the Client instance is
 * created.  This {@code CacheManager} implementation has the following characteristics:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>It assumes a default time-to-live and time-to-idle of 1 hour for all cache entries.</li>
 *     <li>It auto-sizes itself based on your application's memory usage.  It will not cause OutOfMemoryExceptions.
 *         (It does this by retaining only 100 strong references to cached objects.  Additional cached objects are
 *          weakly referenced, ensuring the garbage collector can evict weakly referenced cache entries if it needs
 *          more memory for your application.).
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>but, please note:</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The default cache manager is not suitable for an application deployed across multiple JVMs.</b></p>
 *
 * <p>This is because the default implementation is 100% in-memory (in-process) in the current JVM.  If more than one
 * JVM is deployed with the same application codebase - for example, a web application deployed on multiple identical
 * hosts for scaling or high availability - each JVM would have it's own in-memory cache.  Multiple disconnected caches
 * for the same data will cause cache coherency problems and likely cause errors in your application!</p>
 *
 * <p>As a result, if your application that uses a Okta Client instance is deployed across multiple JVMs, you
 * SHOULD ensure that the Client is configured with a {@code CacheManager} implementation that uses coherent and
 * clustered/distributed memory.</p>
 *
 * <h4>Custom CacheManager</h4>
 *
 * <p>If you want to specify a custom {@code CacheManager} implementation:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * CacheManager cacheManager = new MyCacheManagerImplementation();
 * Client client = {@link com.okta.sdk.client.Clients Clients}.builder().<b>setCacheManager(cacheManager)</b>.build();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h5>Application deployed on a single JVM</h5>
 *
 * <p>If your application is deployed on a <b>single JVM</b> and you still want to use the default
 * {@code CacheManager} implementation, but the default cache configuration does not meet your
 * needs, you can specify a different configuration.  For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import static com.okta.sdk.cache.Caches.*;
 *
 * ...
 *
 * {@link com.okta.sdk.cache.Caches Caches}.{@link com.okta.sdk.cache.Caches#newCacheManager() newCacheManager()}
 *     .withDefaultTimeToLive(300, TimeUnit.SECONDS) // default
 *     .withDefaultTimeToIdle(300, TimeUnit.SECONDS) //general default
 *     .withCache({@link com.okta.sdk.cache.Caches#forResource(Class) forResource}(Account.class) //Account-specific cache settings
 *         .withTimeToLive(1, TimeUnit.HOURS)
 *         .withTimeToIdle(30, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
 *     .withCache({@link com.okta.sdk.cache.Caches#forResource(Class) forResource}(Group.class) //Group-specific cache settings
 *         .withTimeToLive(2, TimeUnit.HOURS))
 *
 *     //... etc ...
 *
 *     .build(); //build the CacheManager
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>See the {@link com.okta.sdk.cache.Caches Caches} utility class and the
 * {@link com.okta.sdk.cache.CacheManagerBuilder CacheManagerBuilder} docs for more information.</p>
 *
 * <h5>Application deployed across multiple JVMs</h5>
 *
 * <p>If your application is deployed across multiple JVMs (for example a web app deployed on multiple web nodes for
 * scale and/or high availability), you will likely need to specify a custom
 * {@code CacheManager} implementation that is based on network distributed/coherent memory.  For example, an
 * implementation might delegate to a <a href="http://hazelcast.org/">Hazelcast</a> or
 * <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> cluster. For example, if using the out-of-the-box Hazelcast plugin:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import com.okta.sdk.hazelcast.HazelcastCacheManager;
 * // ... etc ...
 *
 * //Get a HazelcastInstance from your app/config.  This can be a HazelcastClient instance too:
 * HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = getHazelcastInstanceOrHazelcastClient();
 *
 * CacheManager cacheManager = new HazelcastCacheManager(hazelcastInstance);
 * Client client = {@link com.okta.sdk.client.Clients Clients}.builder().setCacheManager(cacheManager).build();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: it should be noted that <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcache</a> <em>DOES NOT</em> guarantee cache
 * coherency.  It is strongly recommended that you do not use Memcache as your clustered caching solution (memcache
 * is fine for caching files, etc, but not data that is expected to be coherent across multiple cluster nodes).</p>
 *
 * <h4>Disable Caching</h4>
 *
 * <p>While production applications will usually enable a working CacheManager as described above, you might wish to disable caching
 * entirely when testing or debugging to remove 'moving parts' for better clarity into request/response
 * behavior.  You can do this by configuring a <em>disabled</em> {@code CacheManager} instance. For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Client client = {@link com.okta.sdk.client.Clients Clients}.builder().setCacheManager(
 *     <b><code>Caches.newDisabledCacheManager()</code></b>
 * ).build();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Single Instance</h3>
 *
 * <p>Finally, it should be noted that, after building a {@code client} instance, that same instance should be used
 * everywhere in your application. Creating multiple client instances in a single application could have
 * negative side effects:</p>
 *
 * <p>As mentioned above, a client has a {@link #setCacheManager(com.okta.sdk.cache.CacheManager) CacheManager}
 * reference.  If your application uses multiple client instances, each client's referenced CacheManager would likely
 * become out of sync with the others, making your cache
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence">incoherent</a>.  This will likely
 * result in exposing stale data to your application and could data errors.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you must have multiple {@code Client} instances in your application, you should ensure that each client
 * references the same exact {@code CacheManager} instance to guarantee cache coherency.</p>

     * <h3>Multi-JVM / Clustered Applications</h3>
     *
     * <p>The default {@code CacheManager} instances returned by the

     * problems across the JVMs.  See the {@link com.okta.sdk.cache.CacheManagerBuilder CacheManagerBuilder}
     * JavaDoc for additional information.</p>
     *
     * <p>In these multi-JVM environments, you will likely want to create a simple CacheManager implementation that
     * wraps your distributed Caching API/product of choice and then plug that implementation in to the Okta SDK
     * via this method.  Hazelcast is one known cluster-safe caching product, and the Okta SDK has out-of-the-box
     * support for this as an extension module.  See the top-level class JavaDoc for a Hazelcast configuration
     * example.</p>
     *
     * @param cacheManager the {@link CacheManager} that should be used to cache Okta REST resources, reducing
     *                     round-trips to the Okta API server and enhancing application performance.
