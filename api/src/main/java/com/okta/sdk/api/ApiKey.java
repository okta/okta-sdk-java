/**
 * An ApiKey is a secure random username/password pair (called an {@link #getId() id} and
 * {@link #getSecret() secret}) attributed to an {@link Account} that can be used by the account to make secure
 * requests to an API service.
 *
 * <p>An {@link Account Account} may have zero or more ApiKeys, and allowing multiple keys is often useful for key
 * rotation strategies.  For example, a new key can be generated while an existing key is in use.  Applications can
 * then reference the new key (e.g. on startup), and once running, the old key can then be deleted.  This allows for
 * key rotation without an interruption in service, which would happen otherwise if an old key was invalidated the
 * instant a new key was generated.</p>
